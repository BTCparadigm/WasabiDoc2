[WIP]

This is Wasabi Wallet 2.0's open source documentation. 

Even though we have tried to make our new software UI as intuitive as possible, we should still describe the functions of our wallet and explain the magic under the hood, so users can make better decisions regarding their financial privacy.

Everyone is welcome to make the Wasabi Wallet documentation better, by contributing on GitHub!
